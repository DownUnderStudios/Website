		  XAMPP is meant only for development purposes. It has certain configuration settings that make it easy to develop locally but that are insecure if you want to have your installation accessible to others.
		  If you want have your XAMPP accessible from the internet, make sure you understand the implications and you checked the <a href="/dashboard/faq.html">FAQs</a> to learn how to protect your site. Alternatively you can use <a href="https://bitnami.com/stack/wamp">WAMP</a>, <a href="https://bitnami.com/stack/mamp">MAMP</a> or <a href="https://bitnami.com/stack/lamp">LAMP</a> which are similar packages which are more suitable for production.
