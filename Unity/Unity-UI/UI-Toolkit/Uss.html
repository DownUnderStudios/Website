                <p class="article-sub-title">Introduction</p>
USS unity style sheet operate on the same Selector system as CSS by not as fleshed out.
Like is CSS there is a hierarchy with goes * < Type < .Class < #Name < Inline-Style < Pseudo-Classes
They way to think of it is the more specific the selector the more seniority it has.

                
                <p class="article-sub-title"> Selector</p>
                •   * Root Selector <br />
                <p class="article-indent-1">    o	This root selector matches to all elements and affect everything. <br />
                •   Type <br />
                <p class="article-indent-1">    o	The type of element such as “Button” this will affect all of the buttons. <br />
                <p class="article-indent-1">    o	Type overrides the * universal selector <br />
                •   .Class <br />
                <p class="article-indent-1">    o	The Class is represented with the “.ClassName” controls all elements with class name attached. <br />
                <p class="article-indent-1">    o	Class overrides Type <br />
                •   #Name /ID <br />
                <p class="article-indent-1">   o	The Name or (ID in CSS) is the name you give to an element(s) denoted by the “#Name” and any element with that name will be controlled by this. <br />
                <p class="article-indent-1">   o	Name overrides Class <br />
                <br />

                <p class="article-sub-title">Pseudo Classes</p>
                Pseudo classes like in CSS can be attached to Type, Class, Name and will affect if conditions are met. <br />
                •	:hover – when the mouse hovers over an element. <br />
                •	:active – When an Element is active (can be Interacted with). <br />
                •	:inactive – When an Element is inactive (can’t be Interacted with). <br />
                •	:focus – when an element is the current focus. <br />
                •	:selected – This is not implemented yet. <br />
                •	:disabled – When the element is Disabled. <br />
                •	:enabled – When the element is enabled. <br />
                •	:checked – When the element is toggled on. <br />
                •	:root – This is different from the other Pseudo classes as it is used by it’s self to define the default style for the element the style sheet affects <br />
                <br />
                You can combine multiple of these selectors together like in CSS. <br />
                <br />

                <p class="article-title">Properties</p>
                <br />
                
                <p class="article-sub-title">USS Data Types</p>
                •	<length> - Represents a distance value <br />
                •	<number> - Represents either an integer or a number with a fractional component. <br />
                •	<integer> - Represents a whole number. <br />
                •	<color> - Represents a color. You can define with a #HexDecimal code, the rgb() or rgba()function, or a color keyword(for example blue or transparent). <br />
                •	<resource> - Represents an asset in a Resources folder. <br />
                •	<url> - Represents an asset specified by a path. It can be expressed as either a relative path or an absolute path. <br />
                <br />
                
                <p class="article-sub-title">USS Data Types</p>
                UI Toolkit style properties use the same grammar syntax as W3C CSS documents:<br />
                Keyword values appear as is. For example: auto, baseline.<br />
                Basic data types appear between angle brackets ( < and >). For example: <length>, <color>.<br />
                Non-terminals that share the same name as a property appear between angle brackets and single straight quotes ( <' and '>). For example, <'width'>.<br />
                If a property value has more than one component:<br />
                Side-by-side words mean that all of them must occur in the given order.<br />
                A bar (|) separates two or more alternatives: exactly one must occur.<br />
                A double bar (||) separates two or more options: one or more must occur, in any order.<br />
                A double ampersand (&&) separates two or more components, all of which must occur, in any order.<br />
                Square brackets ([ ]) denote grouping.<br />
                Every type, keyword, or angle-bracketed group may be followed by modifiers:<br />
                an asterisk (*) indicates that the preceding type, word, or group occurs zero or more times.<br />
                a plus (+) indicates that the preceding type, word, or group occurs one or more times.<br />
                a question mark (?) indicates that the preceding type, word, or group is optional.<br />
                a pair of numbers in curly braces ({A,B}) indicates that the preceding type, word, or group occurs at least A and at most B times.<br />
                <br />
                
                <p class="article-sub-title">USS custom Properties (Variables)</p>
                Variables like in CSS it uses the prefix of double-hyphen“--". <br />
                For example “—color-1: red”; <br />
                It can be used by var() <br />
                For example var(--color-1); <br />
                Variables is declared in a selector and can b e used by any child selectors, it is common practice to uses the variable in the root selector (*) as all other selectors can uses it. <br />
                <br />
