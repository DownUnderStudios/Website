                <p class="article-sub-title">Introduction</p>
                This series will introduce you to the fundamentals of UI Toolkit,<br />
                And will allow the user to produce new UI’s for both runtime & editor.<br />
                The rest of this introduction will provide you with working terminologies that will make understanding easier,<br />
                As well as list a number of videos topics that will be touched upon.<br />
                The following terminology will be the core of the UI Toolkit and not a complete list any additional terminology will be addressed in their corresponding videos.<br />
                
                <p class="article-sub-title">Terminologies</p>
                •	Visual Element: Base class that all UI elements inherent from and are the main element used.<br />
                •	UI Builder: The UI Builder lets you visually create and edit UI assets such as UI documents (.uxml files), and stylesheets (.uss files), that you use with Unity’s UI Toolkit (formerly UIElements).<br />
                •	UI Document: Is a Component that connects to a Game Objects. This makes it possible to render UI defined in UXML document in the Game view.<br />
                •	Debugger: The UI debugger is a diagnostic tool that resembles a web browser’s debugging view. Use it to explore a hierarchy of elements and get information about its underlying UXML structure and USS styles.<br />
                •	UXML: Unity Extensible Markup Language (UXML) files are text files that define the structure of the user interface.<br />
                •	USS: UI Toolkit supports style sheets written in USS (Unity style sheet). USS files are text files inspired by Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) from HTML. The USS format is similar to CSS, but USS includes overrides and customizations to work better with Unity.<br />

                <p class="article-sub-title">Videos</p>
                •	There will be many videos such as a video on the UI Builder, where to find it and how to works.<br />
                •	How to set the UI for runtime & editor window.<br />
                •	How to debug existing UI with the included Debugger.<br />
                •	How to structure your UI & code in different framework style(s).<br />
                •	Reviewing the code structure of the UI system and how to access different parts thought code.<br />
                •	Creating examples of common UI with UI Builder and how they would properly combine with code.<br />
                •	There may be more videos in the future such as testing out experimental aspects when they are released such as Graph view and animations.<br />
